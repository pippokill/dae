Diachronic Analysis of Entities by Exploiting Wikipedia Page revisions
=========================================================================

Code for the paper "Diachronic Analysis of Entities by Exploiting Wikipedia Page revisions" accepted to RANLP 2019 - RECENT ADVANCES IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING.

In the last few years, the increasing availability of large corpora spanning several time periods has opened new opportunities for the diachronic analysis of language.
This type of analysis can bring to the light not only linguistic phenomena related to the shift of word meanings over time, but it can also be used to study the impact that societal and cultural trends have on this language change.
This paper introduces a new resource for performing the diachronic analysis of named entities built upon Wikipedia page revisions.
This resource enables the analysis over time of changes in the relations between entities (concepts), surface forms (words), and the contexts surrounding entities and surface forms, by analysing the whole history of Wikipedia internal links.

This repository contains the code for creating the resource by exploiting Wikipedia page revisions.
